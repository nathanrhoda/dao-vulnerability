# dao-vulnerability
Understanding the smart contract vulnerability exploited during the DAO attack


In a nutshell using limited recursion so as not to have the contract fail or error out.
Interaction between 2 smart contracts whereby a second smart contract gets called into from parent contract
leaving the child derived contract to be able to restart the process of transferring money / execution etc.




# Parity Attack

Uses the delegate and fallback vulnerability to allow calling contracts that are referencing a library to call methods
in the library that might not have been intended or to even use fall functions to call into libraries and change state or behaviour
